In my search to understand where the future of AI is going, I read "The Master Algorithm" by Pedro Domingos. It taught me that reverse-engineering the learning phenomenon of a human brain is a popular path towards the 'master algorithm' for Strong AI. This link between AI and neuroscience greatly excited me, as it reminded me of attending my high school's research program, STEAM, where I researched dreaming. I delved into the effects of artificial stimulations on dreaming, captivated by the sheer mysteries our brains bear. That said, the book enthralled me with the fact that the yet unrevealed neural network of a brain holds the possible answers to the master algorithm, which engaged me with a further desire to study AI. I believe AI is truly an interdisciplinary science, where I can continue to learn about both genuine & artificial intelligence.science & technology. In essence, such future-leading potential is what inspires me to read computer science with AI at your university.

An ability to interpret data is a significant capability I've gained from my life-long desire to pursue a career in science. However, when confronted with huge data sets, finding their implications still comes to me as a considerable challenge. With this in mind, my main passion in AI (i.e. Artificial Intelligence) was found when I witnessed AlphaGo's excellence in interpreting over 16,000 Go results. The outlandish, yet surprisingly successful strategies of AlphaGo surpassed that of the Go champion's, which even brought a paradigm shift in Go communities. Having thought of this from a scientific perspective, I realized such exceptional data analysis of AI could help scientists interpret observations with magnificent scale, and possibly render brilliant inspirations to them in the same way AlphaGo did to Go players. I believe the true potential of machine learning lies within cooperation between AI and scientists, the great synergy of which could vastly accelerate humanity's race in science & technology. In essence, such future-leading potential is what inspires me to read computer science with AI at your university.

Having read Deepmind's research paper on AlphaGo, I was surprised to know that its mechanism yet includes some simple mathematics I had already learned in IFY program this year. Matrices were not new concepts to me as I was taught in Further Mathematics course, but the application of them in contriving the network layers for Deep Learning algorithms was something fascinatingly new. Similarly, though I had already learned conditional probability in Mathematics Business course, the paper expanded my insight into the uses of it from mere business analysis to a fundamental basis for prediction algorithms of AI. I find it captivating how such basic mathematics can translate into state-of-the-art machine learning technology, an appreciation of which I believe will further aid my later studies of mathematics for AI in university.

To make a successful piece of art can only be accomplished by drawing or painting what I am truly inspired and excited to do, otherwise there is no fulfilment from completing it. My best work has always come through being focused on the job at hand, always wanting to improve my skill and following my instinct. My skill for creating gives me the ability to make anything visual and bring my greatest ideas to life, no matter how obscure or challenging they may be. When I began to really focus on my drawing, I realised the potential I had and wanted to turn this natural talent into something more, something I could find a career in. So I developed my drawing technique through drawing people in different positions, under different lighting and in different environments, making sure all proportions were right, nothing was too small or too big.
