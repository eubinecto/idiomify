## The rationale and the research questions


Administering feedback on student’s writing does not always have students learn something. For example, we know from the literature that correcting students’ grammatical mistakes hardly have them learn the rules of grammar (Truscott, 1996; Conti, 2015). This implies that an automated feedback system for correcting grammars, such as Grammarly, may not necessarily have students improve their grammar as they self-revise grammatical mistakes. However, not all automated feedback systems are solely designed to correct rules. With the help of natural language processing, some of them can intelligently paraphrase sentences to communicate their intended meaning potentially better than before (e.g. Wordtune & Quillbot). Idiomify, which is developed by the author, is one of those paraphrasing feedback systems. It automatically turns literal phrases into idiomatic phrases wherever appropriate. While corrective feedback aims to correct errors, Idiomify feedback aims to communicate meaning in a figurative way. Motivated by the clear difference in their aims, it is hypothesized that their learning benefits may as well differ. Unlike corrective feedback, Idiomify feedback could help students learn something about idioms, as it gives feedback on communicating meaning, not on sticking to a set of rules. This begs the first research question:

> RQ1: To what extent can Idiomify feedback help Korean EFL writers in acquiring English idioms?

Of course, students can learn only so much about idioms with Idiomify feedback alone. They should learn the collocations of idioms, the cultural background to their etymology, how they may be linked to Korean idioms, etc, to achieve both receptive and productive mastery of English idioms in reading & writing. It is worth exploring how such inputs (and maybe outputs) could compensate Idiomify feedback for its limits, which begs the second research question:

> RQ2: Considering the answer(s) to RQ1, what additional inputs or instructions should be administered to the students to compensate Idiomify feedback for its limits?
