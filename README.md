## The rationale and the research questions


Learning to understand and produce idiomatic language is a challenge for foreign language learners (L2 learners). L2 learners significantly lack idiomatic fluency, compared with the native speakers (Thyrab, 2016). Motivated to help them learn idioms, the current study evaluates an automated, computerized software package, called Idiomify, in its effects on the learning of English idioms by Korean learners of English. The study will have implications for the teaching of English idioms as an L2 as well as theoretically in terms of the efficacy of computerized feedback.

Idiomify is an AI-powered literal-to-idiomatic paraphraser developed by the student researcher.  With the help of natural language processing, it can intelligently paraphrase literal phrases into idiomatic phrases wherever appropriate (e.g. I love you more than anything else → I love you to the moon and back). This is useful for communicating the same meaning but potentially better than before, as idioms help us unravel complicated ideas with only a few words by means of analogies.

While the instrumental value of Idiomify as such is clear, whether it has any pedagogical value or not is unclear. This is because we know from the literature that administering feedback on students’ writings per se does not always have them learn something. For example, it has been repeatedly demonstrated that correcting students’ grammatical mistakes hardly help them learn the rules of grammar (e.g. Truscott, 1996; Conti, 2015). This implies that simply instructing students to self-revise their grammatical mistakes with corrective feedback from an automated feedback system, such as Grammarly, may not necessarily have them improve their grammar. To this end, it is reasonable to question if students would learn anything at all from Idiomify feedback.

The current study nevertheless hypothesizes that Idiomify feedback may have learning benefits (in conjunction with other resources that students might usually use). This is because the aim of Idiomify is clearly different from that of Grammarly; While Grammarly aims to correct violations of a set of rules, Idiomify aims to suggest different ways of communicating meaning. Learning the rules of grammar from Grammarly feedback may be less effective because a metalinguistic account for the correction must be accompanied with the feedback, which Grammarly does not provide. Students are therefore likely to fail to make sense of why their mistakes are “mistakes”.  In contrast, learning idioms from Idiomify feedback might be possible even without any further account for the feedback because Idiomify feedback is self-explanatory; students are suggested with a different set of symbols to denote the meaning that they already understand.  Given this contrasting difference in their aims and their expected efficacy thereof, the current study aims to explore the efficacy of Idiomify feedback in facilitating students’ acquisition of idioms.

To address the aim above, we ask the following research questions:
1.	How do students use Idiomify during an L2 writing task?
2.	Does Idiomify help students produce more idiomatic or natural-sounding L2 writing?
3.	Do students learn the idioms suggested to them by Idiomify?  
4.	Is there a relationship between how students use Idiomify and the extent to which they learn any idioms that it suggests? 
5.	Do the answers to the above questions differ according to the L2 proficiency levels of the students?
6.	Do the answers to the above questions differ according to the transparency of the idioms?
 

## The methods 

### Participants
The study will be conducted in IEN-NCUK institute, based in Seoul, South Korea, where students are taught EAP (English for Academic Purposes) classes. Up to 30 EFL writers enrolled in EAP classes will be recruited to participate in the current study. Most of them will be in the 18-20 year old age bracket and nobody will be under 18. Along with students, up to three teachers will be asked to participate in the study as evaluators of students’ writing outcomes.  Participants will receive a small gift as a token of gratitude for their participation. 

### Treatments
All 30 particpants will be asked to perform a writing task taking around 30 minutes. They will be asked to do so on their personal laptops and to record their screen with Microsoft Teams. Their first drafts will be saved. After they finish their first drafts, they will be administered with Idiomify feedback via a website developed by the student researcher. They will then be asked to revise their first drafts based on the feedback given and they will be allowed to use any other external online resources that they might usually access (e.g. online dictionary).  They can spend as long as they like on this and the time taken will be recorded.  

### Instruments
On performing the “writing task”, students will be asked to write a short, non-academic text (e.g. a short journal of how their days have gone so far). On receiving “Idiomify feedback”, they will be asked to copy & paste their text into the Idiomify web application and click “Idiomify” button. They will be given suggestions on any idioms that students could use to rephrase parts of their text. Students could either accept or reject these suggestions, or try “Idiomify” again to get a different suggestions. On using “external resources”, students may choose to look up the definitions, the etymologies, the example context of the suggested idioms or any other information that they may want to search for.

### Procedures
1.	On day one, the participants will be asked to perform the writing task, revise their first and second drafts after receiving Idiomify feedback and any information from external sources they choose to use. Immediately after they are done with their final drafts, the immediate post-test will be completed (formulating the definitions of idioms that they ended up using in their final drafts).
2.	One week days later, the participants will be asked to complete a further task (a delayed post-test), which they will be informed about but will not know the focus. The delayed test will be the same as the immediate post-test they took in step (1).
3.	The day after the delayed post-test, some of the best-performing and worst-performing students will be asked to participate in an interview. They will be asked to perform a simulated recall while watching the recordings of their screen together with the student researcher.
4.	The day after the delayed post-test, the participating teachers will be asked to evaluate the nativeness / naturalness of student’s usage of suggested idioms in their final drafts.
5.	The results of the immediate & delayed post-test for all participants will be returned a week after step 4 above.
